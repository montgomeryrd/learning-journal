<h1># LJ Code 301 - Journal 9</h1>

Damn, I just took the 401 entrance exam and didn't pass. That was a real look into how much I don't know. I'm more than just struggling I guess. I'm starting to think I didn't get much out of week 2, and consequently, I kind of got even less out of week 3. My partner did much of the work on her own time during week 3's pair programming, so when we were actually pair programming together, I often felt lost. We fell behind quickly too. Most of our time was trying to figure out why our code always broke, and then at some point, I just focused on trying to make up the difference to try and help get us caught up. I kind of just think we were both pretty clueless though... so as a pair programming team, things took us longer to accomplish in general. I just want to retake 301. Kind of bummed I gotta wait through Christmas. I'm gonna look into more SQL tutorials... and understand ajax requests better... and... what middleware is doing what... and how to use it all... and get a Chromebook and install Ubuntu...
