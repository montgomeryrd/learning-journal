We took a look at inserting audio and video elements in HTML and used JavaScript to create our own controls to start and pause the audio clip. We also went over how to embed other sites into our own using the iframe tag. Then we covered how to record clicks on images inside of an HTML through a Codepen example by creating an object constructor, instantiating objects and creating an event listener for clicks. I believe we also briefly covered getAttribute and setAttribute. Then we were cut loose to lose our minds on figuring out how to get our app to function properly for the BusMall assignment.
