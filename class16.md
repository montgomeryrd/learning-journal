I learned that I do hacky ass CSS. Today kind of flew by. After I met with my group, we started digging around in our code and I got lost in CSS land. Before long, it was 4pm. It was explained to me that when elements load on a page, it's more effective for it to load top down. I was using margins to kind of put shit where ever, so I started to rework the CSS, restructure the HTML, and utilize floats instead.
