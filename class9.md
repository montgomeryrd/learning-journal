Today was relatively chill, relative to earlier this.week. We saw how methods can call other methods within the prototype. Uhm, we went over some ux, things like being a conversion optimization developer... essentially improving the product of design addressing needs, I suppose. We talked about Themeforest again. We covered some grid design and discussed the defactor standard for transition elements at 350ms. Ha. Animating some CS was neat, but the angry robot introduced in the beginning was way cooler. Oh, and I guess we got a glimpse of the .reduce method. I saw it previously when adding arrays, but I just couldn't figure it out solo.
