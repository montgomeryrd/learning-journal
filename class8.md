Today we covered the form element and constructed a form using inputs and labels with radio, text, checkbox, and submit attributes. It was an exercise using event handling and listening. We reached into the markup, made code, and used the event listener to create objects based on user input. We also spent a little time on CSS. Some other things learned in class today... uh... don't style the checkbox, or the radio, or the select. Using "btn" is a factory standard. Underscores in markup language seem to be preferred to using hyphens as you can run into issues with hyphens in JavaScript code. Oh... and the fieldset element is useful because the input tags are inline and aesthetically terrible.
