Functional Programming
Effect + Logic = Side Effects and we wanna use methods like filter, map, and reduce to reduce side effects. We wanna make code cleaner and easier to read.

Functional features built into JavaScript
Immutable methods:
.forEach
.some
.every
.concat
.filter
.map
.reduce

These methods mutate data:

.sort
.reverse
.splice

Immutability in methods is good because it limits the amount of things that change reducing risk of potentially breaking code.

Declarative vs Imperative... Imperative is very defined steps, so like... a for-loop can be read step by step, whereas using .forEach is declarative cause even though we know how the method works, the steps are not shown.
