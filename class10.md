Class 10 was for the most part, a recap of the week: We talked about the DOM and application program interfaces. We covered object literals containing strings, integers, arrays, methods, and other objects... We had a brief introduction to JSON or JavaScript Object Notation, which is the most widely used format for handling and passing data on the internet. We went into object constructors and how they instantiate objects (create). We also covered JS debugging using the chrome console. Uhm... again, the defacto internet speed for animation is 350 milliseconds. Last, we talked about our Chocolate Pizza assignment and how merge conflicts work and things to consider such as page width: 960px, gutter size, margin: auto.
