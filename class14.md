Today we talked a little about JQuery, the good and the bad. The good is that there are plenty of tools in the JQuery library to utilize in constructing applications that have essentially streamlined coding. Bad because it's made programmers lazy in the way that the way people code can be a mess, not comforming to standards or best practices. Today really... was about project ideas and project management. I'm part of Team Secret Decoder Ring. We went over the MVP of our product, which some of our team seem to be extremely confident in producing. Our wed app will encode and decode messages. I'm excited to see what we can produce in a week. I believe we have a lot of stretch goals to potentially meet. I'm not super sure the functionality of such a project, but it should be fun either way.
