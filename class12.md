Today we went over Jeremy's assignment. Jeremy is next level. I feel like if coding was a car, I can change the oil, refuel the gas tank, change a headlight, but anything beyond that and I ask Jeremy for help. What I learned today was that I spent about 8 hours trying to get a function to work how I wanted it to and then finally when I was able to meet with a TA, I found out that I was recording an array into an array instead of the data from one array into an array. That one misunderstanding ruined my day yesterday. Today's successes was in bounds compared to yesterday, but I did get a lot of help. I think the main take-away from class today was using libraries. Chart.js. I haven't got mine working just yet, but I was trying to chart my data to a different html file and that may have some extra steps. Aesthetically, I wanted my site to have a link that would appear after 25 image-clicks that the user could navigate to a page with my chart. That achievement remains locked for now.
