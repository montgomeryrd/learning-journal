Today we started by writing literal objects. If my understanding is super correct, all variables are objects... properties of objects are objects... functions in objects are methods. Hmmm... anytime you see a word with a "."... it is in relation to an object, and to call properties or methods, you would use dot notation starting with the parent object followed by a dot and then the property you want to call. Using dot notation, you can go all the way down into an object to even call shit within arrays by identifying the [i] of the thing you want to call.

.split is a method that takes a string, splits it up, and creates an array.
.join is a method that takes an array and joins it into a string.

We also learned how to create markup language and append it into an HTML document. I'm gonna need more time staring at that and practicing.
