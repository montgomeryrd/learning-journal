The part I struggle with most is JavaScript. Even though it's vanilla, I don't possess the ability to think in code yet. I can read vanilla code just fine. I'll look through script and understand the logic. I can even understand what needs to happen in order for the functions or app to work. I'm just not so great at the words... the syntax, knowing what code to use. I guess what I learned today is what I already knew, but my awareness++. I'm excited to do more, learn more. 201 is close to an end.
