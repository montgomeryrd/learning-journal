<h1># LJ Code 301 - Journal 7</h1>

All week, we've kind of gone over differences in front-end and back-end, but pretty much lived in the back-end. I learned, but tend to forget, that I need to 'npm i' every time I start the assignment for my dependencies. The weekend was great at compartmentalizing everything I've been learning. I drank pretty consistently over the weekend so that might've contributed too. If I heard correctly, the packages we download for our package.json, they kind of exist in this magical ethereal land of code, so when I close out the terminal... and I think other associated programs, I'll need to npm i again for my dependencies. Also, which I tend to forget, I use a special conString because I'm a Windows kind of special. I think what I learned most of all is that Windows comes with a set of challenges... as well... as new ones, but why? Microsoft is as old as me! 

Front-end
html
css
js
jquery
view
deploy on gh pages

Back-end

node
dependencies
model and controller
deploy on heroku


I wish i could say I learned something in the uI Challenge, but I thought the scope of the assignment was to use JavaScript to append the sprites to the page to style of which I wasn't successful in 3 hours, but also didn't realize how much CSS was involved. Pretty sure the assignment said to use JS... and I still don't know.
