We've been focusing a bit on responsive web design and using media queries. The in class demo showed us how media queries can provide more control over the page environment when the screen size is altered and how we can establish different styles for each query. Our first lab assignment, 01-mobile-first, gave us a chance to explore using a media query for a mobile view to a desktop view along with some CSS styles, for ourselves... anduh... we learned how to implement a hamburger menu.
