Today was good. There was CSS syntax I learned from MDN regarding element positioning and then I read about it in a reading assignment, but never saw it in action until today. It put floating elements into perspective. Same goes for custom functions. I've been waiting to get exposure to them. I really can't wait to start using them effectively. I probably wasn't the best navigator in today's assignment. I feel I've hit my mental capacity early today, but it was great to be exposed to another individual's way of thinking. I mean, Roger knew what he wanted to do with his code right away; and working through it, he picked up the logic behind the code quickly as he communicated through the function. There's more I want to do with my code, but I'd like to get some actual rest first. I burned the candle on both ends last night and this morning. Today was also a first for doing pull requests. Before this course started, I read through the tutorial on Git and so... I've kind of been waiting to delve more into that as well. I've realized over the last few days that I really need to observe the 15-minute rule. I've been spending too much time on... I mean... when I finally figure it out, I feel a little foolish. The satisfaction factor is huge, but at the same time, it's like, ugh... if I saw this sooner... or if I thought about it this other way sooner. Tomorrow is Friday. How exciting! I want to heal... and edit my page with a little bit of leisure.
