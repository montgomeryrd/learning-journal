<h1># LJ Code 301 - Day 4</h1>

We talked about the Model View Controller. Honestly, I needed to pay more attention. So tired.

We spent some time learning AJAX and JSON syntax as well as JQuery's ajax, getJSON.

JSON is a standard way to serialize your objects.
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
We mostly use JSON as the standard these days.

Our assignment was fairly easy, and allowed us to use getJSON data, load the data to our page, and then stringify it to load it into localStorage.

We covered pretty much everything from the recent "brother's conversation" including HTTP, Hyper text transfer protocol, which is a protocol used to communicate data across the web. We talked about URLs, uniform resource locater, which is the location or source of data. We also covered URIs, uniform resource identifier, which identifies the data... kind of a less informed URL from my understanding.

We talked about the structure of URLs: protocol, domain, path, format, named anchor, parameters

HTTP Request has 3 parts
a URL a Method and Headers

An HTTP response also has 3 parts
Status Code, Header, Body

REST, or... the structure of the world wide web, stands for Representational State Transfer... which applies verbs to nouns. It points to a representation of a source. The common methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE or CRUD... which is a little easier to understand: Create(POST), read(GET), update(PUT), delete(DELETE).

What else, what else, what else... Brian left 3 cups in class... forgot his jacket, and his bag. We're in an episode of Seinfield. 3 cups Brian?! THREE!
