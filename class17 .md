Today has been a good day. This morning was met with merge conflicts gone wrong. Thankfully it was only HTML and CSS related. We got that straightened out and hammered down a few scripts for more functionality within our page such as a copy link button and switching new users for our application and keeping track of user keys. We found some bugs and fixed em. We got hit with some stretch goals and got some of em done. Other than that, we're just considering more stretch goals and working on an about me page. We have our MVP at least.
