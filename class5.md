I read the github tutorial a while back and was waiting to delve into branches. I mean, not that I was stoked or anything, but I knew they were coming and I get the functionality of them working within a group. Oh, and we learned how to create and navigate branches in the terminal. The main take away from today was definitely digging into some CSS to create the beginnings of an aesthetic layout. It was nice to work through the structure of a clean HTML page, and editing the CSS through the dev tools in Google is a great way to make changes in "real time".
