Today we didn't do a whole lot. There were minor changes, but nothing as far as implenting new stretch goals. We kind of mulled presentation day over in our heads and together. Dan and Jamie had whiteboarding sessions and Jeremy wasn't feeling well. I suppose one issue I was having on my laptop was this textarea that would momentarily appear in the upper left of my screen. I realized a google chrome plugin called grammarly was causing it.
