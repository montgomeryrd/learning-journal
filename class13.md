Today we had a look into Jordan's code. There are some things there that I'd like to emulate in the future like how he utilizes comment code to distinguish relatable sections of code and also how he commented for each line explaining what that line does. I think that's a very beneficial way to process what I'm doing in my code. Personally, I'll have something in mind and lose it part of the way in. Then we covered localStorage methods such as getItem, setItem, key, length, removeItem, and clear. We talked about key value pairs and did a demonstration using user input. Oh... and we talked about how object Object means we missed something. Need to use commands JSON.stringify and .parse to switch data back and forth between script and localStorage data (I believe).
