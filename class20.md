Today was presentation day. I don't know what I learned. The presentations were awesome and some really cool web apps were presented. I got a little jealous of some people's knowledge of coding and what they've accomplished. I listened to the salary negotiation power hour. There were some interesting tips... it made me start thinking though that a little honesty and fair value from a company is one that I would want to work for. If a company was trying to pay me a bottom price, I think it might be a shit place to be at unelss it's a startup. After presentations was nice. It was nice to relax with the class eating pizza. It was nice heading over to the 5 Point and getting a few drinks with the TAs. I'm eager to get into 301 and get into pair programming.
