<h1># LJ Code 301 - Day 3</h1>

We dabbled in regex, short for regular expression. It's a way of describing a search pattern in strings using tokens... sequences, anchors, constructs, classes... among other expressions. Typically these regex expressions are used in conjunction with a method to match or verify data.

The other thing we focused on was handlebars.js. Handlebars is a templating engine used to generate templates and use them using the Handlebars compiler. Some people reference it as templates on steroids. It seems cool. I wonder how useful Handlebars is in front web development. I imagine react probably simplifies templating too.
