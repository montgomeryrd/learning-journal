<h1># LJ Code 301 - Journal 5</h1>

We explored some node.js working within the node command prompt and a little Express.js, which I believe is a framework for organization and structure building using requests and responses. We also used Nodemon to live-server our .js files. Our lab was fairly simple if you followed along with the demo well enough. If I'm getting it correctly, Node.js helps link the frontend with the backend of coding but all in Javascript. Now we're starting SQL and more into databases. SQL is interesting because it feels more straight forward. Like, your commands feel more like english sentences. I mentioned in a reading assignment that an advantage I see right away is being able to retrieve relatable information easier than looping through indexes to find them. Today we saw how JavaScript is used to query the database for information and use methods to process that information.
